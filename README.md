# 0.version NLP + MACHINE LEARNING
- Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Machine Learning (ML) models to train a predictive text model.
- Gather a diverse dataset that includes text from various sources, such as articles, blogs, and social media.
- Ensure data is clean, labeled, and representative of the target audience.
-TF-IDF Calculation: Use TF-IDF to transform the textual data into numerical format, highlighting the importance of terms in the context of the entire corpus.
- Vectorization: Convert TF-IDF scores into feature vectors suitable for ML algorithms
- Evaluate different ML models for text classification and generation, such as:
    + Logistic Regression
    + Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    + Random Forests
    + **Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, Transformer models)**

# 3.version RESUME PARSER WITH NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER WITH SCRAPPING WEB DATA) 
## Resume Parser: Automate Resume Processing and Entity Extraction
This project outlines an approach to build a resume parser that automates the process of extracting valuable information from resumes, such as names, emails, phone numbers, skills, and work experience.
### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
**Web Scraping**
* Utilize robust web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to extract resumes from relevant websites (e.g., job boards, LinkedIn profiles).
* Employ advanced techniques like headless browsers (e.g., Selenium) to handle dynamic content and bypass anti-scraping measures.
* **Important:** Always respect website terms of service and avoid unethical scraping practices.
**Data Cleaning and Formatting**
* Remove noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information from extracted resumes.
* Normalize text, handle special characters, and ensure consistent formatting.
* Convert unstructured resumes into a structured format (e.g., JSON, XML) for easier processing.
### 2. NER Model Training
**Dataset Preparation**
* Create a labeled dataset by manually annotating entities (e.g., name, email, phone, skills, experience) in the extracted resumes.
* Consider using tools like Prodigy or Brat for efficient annotation.
**Model Selection and Training**
* Choose a suitable NER model architecture (e.g., BiLSTM-CRF, BERT) based on the complexity of the task and available resources.
* Train the model on the labeled dataset using appropriate hyperparameters and optimization techniques.
* Experiment with different techniques like transfer learning, data augmentation, and ensemble methods to improve performance.
### 3. Resume Parsing and Entity Extraction
**Resume Preprocessing**
* Apply preprocessing steps similar to the data acquisition phase to ensure consistency.
**NER Model Application**
* Feed the preprocessed resume into the trained NER model to identify and extract entities.
* Use techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing to enhance accuracy.
**Entity Extraction and Formatting**
* Extract the identified entities and format them appropriately (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses).
* Consider using regular expressions or specialized libraries for specific entity types.
### 4. Evaluation and Refinement
**Evaluation Metrics**
* Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set.
* Analyze the errors made by the model to identify areas for improvement.
**Model Refinement**
* Iteratively refine the model by adjusting hyperparameters, collecting more data, or exploring different architectures.
* Experiment with techniques like active learning to prioritize annotation of difficult cases.
### 5. Integration and Deploy Application
**Integration with Other Systems**
* Integrate the resume parser into your existing systems or applications using APIs or microservices.
**Deployment**
* Deploy the trained model and parsing pipeline to a production environment, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
