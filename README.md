- Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Machine Learning (ML) models to train a predictive text model.
- Gather a diverse dataset that includes text from various sources, such as articles, blogs, and social media.
- Ensure data is clean, labeled, and representative of the target audience.
-TF-IDF Calculation: Use TF-IDF to transform the textual data into numerical format, highlighting the importance of terms in the context of the entire corpus.
- Vectorization: Convert TF-IDF scores into feature vectors suitable for ML algorithms
- Evaluate different ML models for text classification and generation, such as:
    + Logistic Regression
    + Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    + Random Forests
    + **Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, Transformer models)**
