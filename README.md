# 0.version NLP + Machine Learning
- Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Machine Learning (ML) models to train a predictive text model.
- Gather a diverse dataset that includes text from various sources, such as articles, blogs, and social media.
- Ensure data is clean, labeled, and representative of the target audience.
-TF-IDF Calculation: Use TF-IDF to transform the textual data into numerical format, highlighting the importance of terms in the context of the entire corpus.
- Vectorization: Convert TF-IDF scores into feature vectors suitable for ML algorithms
- Evaluate different ML models for text classification and generation, such as:
    + Logistic Regression
    + Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    + Random Forests
    + **Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, Transformer models)**

# 2.version Resume Parser with Named Entity Recognition (NER)
## Overview
This project develops a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to automatically extract key information from resumes, including names, contact details, education, work experience, and skills.
## Objectives
- **Automate Data Extraction**: Streamline the recruitment process by retrieving structured candidate information from unstructured resumes.
- **Custom Model Training**: Train a model tailored for resume parsing.
## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Compile a diverse set of resumes.
2. **Data Annotation**: Label entities like names, emails, and skills.
3. **Model Training**: Use frameworks like SpaCy or Hugging Face Transformers.
4. **Evaluation**: Measure performance with precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Tools & Technologies
- **Frameworks**: SpaCy, **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **Language**: Python
